As physical distances between people increase day by day,some of the most popular and widespread ways to ‘connect’people remotely, namely audio/video calling and written tex-ting, are able to satisfy the auditory and visual sensoriesbut fall short on a very crucial front- being able to communi-cate the intimate feeling of touch. In this report we presenta review of some of the explorations done in the field oftouch and haptics, and try to weigh in on some of the frontsthose products excelled in and were limited by. Armed withthis analysis, we propose and present ‘Remote Touch’, adevice that is capable of remotely sending and receivingpersonalised and intimate touch pattern.
